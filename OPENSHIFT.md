# Openshift

OpenShift is a container application platform developed by Red Hat, which is based on the Kubernetes container
orchestration system. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and functionalities for deploying, managing, and scaling
containerized applications.

OpenShift simplifies the process of building, deploying, and running applications by providing features such as
automated build and deployment pipelines, container image management, scaling capabilities, service discovery, and load
balancing. It allows developers to focus on writing code and delivering features, while the platform takes care of
infrastructure management and container orchestration.

OpenShift provides a scalable and flexible platform for running both traditional and cloud-native applications. It
supports various programming languages, frameworks, and databases, enabling developers to use their preferred tools and
technologies. It also offers built-in security features, access controls, and monitoring capabilities to ensure the
stability and reliability of applications.

With its robust ecosystem, OpenShift allows organizations to build and deploy applications across multiple environments,
including on-premises data centers, public clouds, and hybrid cloud setups. It promotes collaboration and DevOps
practices by enabling teams to work together efficiently and automate the application lifecycle management process.

In summary, OpenShift is a powerful container application platform that provides developers and organizations with the
tools and capabilities needed to build, deploy, and manage modern applications with ease.


## Openshift resources:

OpenShift involves different teams and resource types to facilitate efficient application development and management.
The two main teams involved are:

<ol><li>OpenShift Administrator Team:These are the experts responsible for setting up and maintaining OpenShift clusters.
They play a crucial role in ensuring the smooth operation of the platform.</li>
<li>Application Development Team: This team focuses on delivering business value by writing code and deploying applications to OpenShift.
They utilize a variety of tools called OpenShift Resources to run their applications.</li></ol>

OpenShift offers various resource types, each with its own unique functionality. Some of the commonly used resource
types include:

* User
* DeploymentConfig
* Build
* ImageStream
* Route
* Project
* ReplicationController
* BuildConfig
* ImageStreamTag
* Template
* Pod
* ConfigMap
* Secret
* Service
* Autoscaler (HPA)

The first type of team is the OpenShift Administrator team.
These are the people who set up and maintain OpenShift clusters.
Administrator teams are very important because there would be no OpenShift without them, but they are
not the only group to use OpenShift.
The second kind of team is the application development team.
Application development teams are responsible for delivering business value by writing code and deploying
applications to OpenShift.
Application developers have a whole different set of concerns than administrators.
Developers don't need to learn how to set up an OpenShift cluster or how to maintain one.
Instead, developers need to learn how to use a variety of tools called OpenShift Resources in order
to run their applications.
OpenShift has many different resource types, each with its own unique functionality.
